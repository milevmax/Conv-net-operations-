# Conv-net-operations
Your task involves implementing Conv2d and Conv2dTranspose operations and
comparing them with PyTorch's equivalents. You have to use only basic tensor
operations from PyTorch. The solution when you’re using F.conv2d or
F.conv2d operations is not valid.

1) Implement Conv2d Forward Operation
2) Implement MaxPool2d Forward Operation

   Add testing and validation for your solution
