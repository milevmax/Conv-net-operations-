# Conv-net-operations
Your task involves implementing Conv2d and MaxPool2d operations and
comparing them with PyTorch's equivalents. You have to use only basic tensor
operations from PyTorch. The solution when youâ€™re using F.conv2d or
F.MaxPool2d operations is not valid.

1) Implement Conv2d Forward Operation
2) Implement MaxPool2d Forward Operation

   Add testing and validation for your solution
